\section{Goals}

In this lab we will create a launcher that launches three nodes:

\begin{itemize}
 \item one (\texttt{capture\_key\_node}) for capturing keystrokes  from the keyboard and publish it in ROS.
\item  the other two (\texttt{move\_joint\_node}) that subscribe to the same type of topic published by the \texttt{capture\_key\_node},
moving each one a predefined articulation of the robot defined by parameter.
The keys used to increment and decrement the position as well as the increment value are defined by parameters  in each node \texttt{move\_joint\_node}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
 \item A text file with the answers to the questions of this sheet
 \item The launch files of the first task
\end{itemize}
Files should be zipped and sent by mail (G. Garcia) or through the lab upload form (O. Kermorgant).

\section{Specification of the robot and available packages}

The Baxter robot has $2\times 7$ joints as shown in \Fig{baxter}, the names of which are listed in the table.
The goal is to have each group control 2 of the joints through the same topic.

\subsection{Available packages}

Two packages are included in this lab:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{capture\_key} contains a single node (\texttt{capture\_key\_node}) that:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Captures the keystrokes
  \item Publishes their ASCII code on the \texttt{/key\_typed} topic
  \item Does not subscribe to any topic
 \end{itemize}
 \item \texttt{move\_joint} contains a single node (\texttt{move\_joint\_node}) that:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Moves the joint of a robot in position mode, incremening or decrementing it according to the key which as been typed.
  \item Subscribes to:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{/key\_hit} as topic for the incoming key strokes
   \item \texttt{/robot/joint\_states} for the current state variables of the robot
  \end{itemize}
  \item Publishes a joint command for the controlled joint, to the topic \texttt{/joint\_command}
  \item Has the following parameters:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{joint\_name} to tell the joint to be controlled. This parameter is mandatory and does not have a default value.
   \item \texttt{incr\_key} for the increment key (default +, ASCII code 43)
   \item \texttt{decr\_key} for the increment key (default -, ASCII code 45)
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
